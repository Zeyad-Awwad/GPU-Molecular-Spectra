# GPU-Molecular-Spectra
An initial implementation of fast dynamic opacities using GPUs, combined with a partial implementation of atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles. The full calculation, using the method described in Guillot (2010), was omitted from the upload due to significant inaccuracies that I'm currently trying to resolve.
