# GPU-Molecular-Spectra
An initial implementation of fast dynamic opacities on GPUs using Julia's CUDA.jl library, combined with a partial implementation of atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles. The calculation of atmospheric profiles, using the method described in Guillot (2010), was omitted from the upload due to significant inaccuracies that I'm currently trying to resolve.
